Waverly Hotels, Inc. is incorporated in Delaware with its principal place of business in North Carolina. Slate Construction is a business partnership (unincorporated association) based in Maryland, owned by partners who are domiciled in Delaware, Pennsylvania, and Maryland. Modern Interiors, Inc. is incorporated and has its principal place of business in North Carolina. 

Waverly contracted with Slate for the construction of a new hotel in Greensboro, North Carolina. Under the contract, Slate was to receive a total of $800,000 for the job: an initial $400,000 payment at the start of the project, and another $400,000 upon completion. The contract provided that Waverly would reimburse Slate for any additional expenses attributable to delays caused by Waverly. Waverly also agreed to indemnify Slate for any claims against Slate by its subcontractors resulting from Waverly's acts or omissions. 

Slate hired Modern Interiors as a subcontractor to design the hotel interior and to supply the furniture and fixtures (lighting, bathrooms, etc.). Under that contract, Modern Interiors was to receive a total of $200,000 for its work: an initial $100,000 payment at the start of the job, and another $100,000 upon completion. In addition, Waverly agreed to guarantee payment under the subcontract. 

About halfway through the project, work was delayed for several days because of a problem with the power supply at the site. As a result of the changes and delay, Slate incurred an additional $60,000 in expenses. When the job was complete, Waverly paid Slate the remaining $400,000 as agreed in the contract. But Waverly refused to pay the additional $60,000 attributed to the delay, asserting that the power supply was Slate's responsibility. 

Slate in turn did not make the final $100,000 to Modern Interiors under their subcontract. Modern Interiors sues Slate in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina, seeking $100,000 in damages for breach of contract.

1. Does the federal court have subject matter jurisdiction? 

Regardless of your answer, assume that the federal court does have subject matter jurisdiction. For each of the following additional claims, explain (i) whether joinder is proper under the FRCP, and (ii) whether the federal court would have subject matter jurisdiction over the claim:

2. A claim by Slate against Modern Interiors for breach of contract, alleging that the fixtures Modern Interiors installed did not conform to the contract specifications and that Slate incurred $50,000 in additional costs to replace them. 

3. A claim by Slate against Waverly, alleging that Waverly owes a contractual duty to indemnify Slate for the breach of contract claim by Modern Interiors.  

4. A claim by Slate against Waverly for breach of contract, seeking payment of the additional $60,000 incurred as a result of changes and delays in the project. 

5. A claim by Modern Interiors against Waverly for the $100,000 due on the subcontract between Slate and Modern Interiors, alleging that Waverly guaranteed payment in the event that Slate did not pay.
