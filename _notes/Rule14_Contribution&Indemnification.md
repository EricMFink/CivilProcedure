### Indemnification and Contribution 

The last clause of Rule 13(g) ("a claim that the coparty is or may be liable to the crossclaimant for all or part of a claim asserted in the action against the crossclaimant") describes claims for _contribution_ and _indemnification_. 

##### Contribution

Allows a joint tortfeasor who pays damages beyond their proportionate share of fault (e.g. under joint and several liability) to seek reimbursement from other joint tortfeasors for their proportionate shares. 

The right of contribution is governed by state law (statute or common law).  

##### Indemnification

Allows a defendant to recover the full amount of a judgment (and sometimes defense costs) from another person. 

- The common law right of indemnification applies where a defendant was not actually at fault, but is liable to the plaintiff based on the other person's conduct. 
  - Example:  At common law, if an employer was held vicariously liable for an employee's negligence, the employer had a right to sue the employee for indemnification. 
    - In some states this particular right has been abrogated by judicial opinion or statute. 
- Statutory indemnification may codify the common law right or impose a duty to indemnify where it would not apply under common law. 
  - Example: In some states, an employer has a statutory duty to indemnify an employee for any civil liability (including the cost of defense) arising from the employee's negligence in the course of employment. See, e.g., Cal. Labor Code ยง 2802(a) .  
- Contractual indemnification agreements allow parties to shift ultimate responsibility for judgments, without regard to which one is at fault. 
  - Example: University places students in internships with businesses and other organizations. The University may agree to indemnify the organizations for any civil liability the organizations incur as a result of the student's conduct. 
  - Liability insurance is a common type of contractual indemnification agreement.
