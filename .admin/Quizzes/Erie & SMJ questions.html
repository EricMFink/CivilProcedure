<h3 id="question-1">Question 1</h3>

<p>In which of the following cases would a federal court have diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332 (assuming all claims arise under state law)?</p>

<p>A. Abel (citizen of VA) sues Baker &amp; Charlie (both citizens of NC) to recover a painting worth $100,0000 that is currently in an art gallery owned by Baker &amp; Charlie. Abel contends that the painting was stolen from Abel’s home, that Baker &amp; Charlie bought it from the thief, and that they knew or should have known it was stolen.</p>

<p>B. Betty (citizen of NC) sues Dupree (citizen of VA) seeking $50,000 in damages for fraud, alleging that a diamond ring Dupree sold her was really made of glass. In the same action, Betty also asserts an unrelated negligence claim against Dupree, seeking $50,000 for property damage and personal injuries she sustained when a drunken Dupree crashed into Betty’s car.</p>

<p>C. Neff (citizen of CA) owns a parcel of land in Oregon valued at $75,000. After Neff fails to respond to a breach of contract suit by Mitchell (citizen of OR), Neff’s property is attached and sold at a sheriff’s auction to satisfy the default judgment in favor of Mitchell. Pennoyer (citizen of OR) buys the property at the sheriff’s auction. Alleging that the default judgment in favor of Mitchell was void for lack of personal jurisdiction, Neff brings a quiet title action against Pennoyer.</p>

<p>D. None of the above.</p>

<h3 id="question-2">Question 2</h3>

<p>Perry (citizen of NC) has a homeowner’s insurance policy from Dependable Ins. Co. (citizen of DE), which he bought through a local agent, Delilah (citizen of NC). Perry submits a claim for coverage after a broken water main under his front yard results in property damage costing $50,000 to repair. Dependable denies the claim, asserting that the policy does not cover “flood damage”. Perry sues Dependable for breach of contract &amp; bad faith denial of an insurance claim under state law. He seeks $50,000 in compensatory damages and another $50,000 in punitive damages. If Perry files in DE state court, may Dependable remove to federal court?</p>

<p>A. Yes, provided state law would allow recovery of punitive damages.</p>

<p>B. Yes, if Dependable raises a defense based on federal law.</p>

<p>C. No, because Delilah, the Dependable agent who sold the policy, is a citizen of NC.</p>

<p>D. None of the above.</p>

<h3 id="question-3">Question 3</h3>

<p>A. A federal court would have diversity jurisdiction over both claims.</p>

<p>B. A federal court would have diversity jurisdiction over the wrongful death claim and supplemental jurisdiction over the emotional distress claim.</p>

<h3 id="question-4">Question 4</h3>

<p>Neff (citizen of CA) visits Oregon and is astonished to find a house on a parcel of land that Neff had purchased some years earlier from Mitchell (citizen of OR). After some investigation, Neff learns that the house was built and is currently occupied by Pennoyer (citizen of OR), who also claims to have purchased the land from Mitchell. Neff brings a quiet title action in federal court against Pennoyer, seeking a declaratory judgment that Neff is the sole rightful owner of the property. Under state law, Pennoyer may, in the same action, assert his own claim against Mitchell to recover damages for breach of contract &amp; fraud in the event the court decides the quiet title action in favor of Neff. Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (FRCP), Pennoyer may not assert such a claim against Mitchell in the quiet title action and would have to do so separately following the outcome of the quiet title suit. Which law should the federal court apply to each issue?</p>

<p>A. State law regarding the burden of proof in the quiet title claim, but federal law regarding the inclusion of Pennoyer’s claim against Mitchell in the same action.</p>

<p>B. Federal law regarding the burden of proof in the quiet title claim, but state law regarding the inclusion of Pennoyer’s claim against Mitchell in the same action.</p>

<p>C. State law regarding both issues.</p>

<p>D. Federal law regarding both issues.</p>

<h3 id="question-5">Question 5</h3>

<p>In which of the following instances must a federal court apply state law, rather than federal law, in a diversity case?</p>

<p>B. State law requires a plaintiff asserting a claim for breach of a written contract must attach a copy of the contract to the complinat, but federal law doesn’t require that a copy of the contract be produced until discovery.</p>

<p>C. Under state law, all civil claims with an amount in controversy less than $100,000 are referred to mediation before the parties may proceed to trial, but federal law has no such requirement.</p>

<p>D. All of the above.</p>
