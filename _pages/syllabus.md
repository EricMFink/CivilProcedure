# Description

In this course, you will learn about the procedures for civil suits. You will also learn how to understand and use primary legal texts (constitutions, statutes, rules, & judicial opinions) as tools for analyzing legal problems and making legal arguments. While the course will focus on federal courts, the rules of civil procedure in many states (including North Carolina) are similar. 

Topics to be covered include the scope of a lawsuit, selection of an appropriate forum, presentation of claims and defenses, choice of applicable law, disposition without a trial, and the effect of judgments on future litigation. Other aspects of civil litigation (e.g., discovery, trials, & appeals) are covered in upper-level elective courses. 

# Required Materials

Click & Learn: Civil Procedure (Carolina Academic Press)

All other assigned reading (cases, statutes, rules, etc.) are available online via the course site, [`emfink.net/CivilProcedure`](https://www.emfink.net/CivilProcedure). The course site also has subject outlines, visual aids, review problems, and past exam questions.

# Policies 

### Grading

Your final grade for the term will be based on review quizzes (40% total) and a final exam (60%). The review quizzes will consist of multiple choice questions and will be open-book/open-notes. You will take the quizzes outside of class on Click to Learn, as indicated in the Course Schedule section below. The final exam will consist of short-answer and essay questions and will be closed-book/closed-notes. You will take the exam online during the exam period. 

### Class Preparation, Attendance, & Participation

Successful performance in this course depends on completion of all reading assignments before class, regular and prompt class attendence, and constructive engagement during class. 

Elon Law School's standards and ABA guidance for awarding course credit assume at least two hours of out-of-class student work for each hour of classroom instruction. 

Elon Law School has adopted the following attendance policy for all courses: 

> The Law School administers a policy that a student maintain regular and punctual class attendance in all courses in which the student is registered, including externships, clinical courses, or simulation courses. Faculty members will give students written notice of their attendance policies before or during the first week of class. These policies may include, but are not limited to: treating late arrivals, early departures, and/or lack of preparation as absences; imposing grade or point reductions for absences, including assigning a failing grade or involuntarily withdrawing a student from the class; and any other policies that a professor deems appropriate to create a rigorous and professional classroom environment.
>
> In case of illness or emergency, students may contact the Office of Student and Professional Life, which will then notify the student’s instructors. A student may notify the faculty member directly of a planned absence and should refer to individual faculty members regarding any policy that may apply. In the case of prolonged illness or incapacity, the student should contact the Office of Student and Professional Life.
