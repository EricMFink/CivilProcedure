# Description

In this course, you will learn about the procedures for civil suits. Topics to be covered include the scope of a lawsuit, selection of an appropriate forum, presentation of claims and defenses, choice of applicable law, disposition without a trial, and the effect of judgments on future litigation. Other aspects of civil litigation (e.g., discovery, trials, & appeals) are covered in upper-level elective courses. While the course will focus on federal courts, the rules of civil procedure in many states (including North Carolina) are similar. 

This course is intended to prepare you for legal practice by developing the knowledge and skill required to recognize and analyze procedural issues, advise clients on those issues and the available options, and to draft pleadings and pre-trial motions. 

# Required Materials

Cases, statutes, rules, and other assigned readings (see "Schedule & Assignments") are available online via the course site [`emfink.net/CivilProcedure`](https://www.emfink.net/CivilProcedure). The course site also has subject outlines, visual aids, review problems, past exam questions, and links to other useful resources.

[Click & Learn: Civil Procedure](https://clickandlearnguide.com/) (Carolina Academic Press). This is an online interactive resource that will help you review and master the legal principles covered in the course. 

# Policies 

### Grading

Your final grade for the term will be based on the assigned Click & Learn review questions (40% total) and a final exam (60%). 

- You will complete the assigned Click & Learn questions outside of class. You should complete the questions for each unit of the course by the dates indicated in the Schedule & Assignments section of the syllabus. 
- The final exam will consist of essay and short-answer questions and will be administered during the Fall term exam period, as scheduled by the Law School Registrar. 

### Class Preparation, Attendance, & Participation

Successful performance in this course depends on completion of all reading assignments before class, regular and prompt class attendence, and constructive engagement during class. Elon Law School's standards and ABA guidance for awarding course credit assume at least two hours of out-of-class student work for each hour of classroom instruction. 

Elon Law School has adopted the following attendance policy for all courses: 

> The Law School administers a policy that a student maintain regular and punctual class attendance in all courses in which the student is registered, including externships, clinical courses, or simulation courses. Faculty members will give students written notice of their attendance policies before or during the first week of class. These policies may include, but are not limited to: treating late arrivals, early departures, and/or lack of preparation as absences; imposing grade or point reductions for absences, including assigning a failing grade or involuntarily withdrawing a student from the class; and any other policies that a professor deems appropriate to create a rigorous and professional classroom environment.
>
> In case of illness or emergency, students may contact the Office of Student and Professional Life, which will then notify the student’s instructors. A student may notify the faculty member directly of a planned absence and should refer to individual faculty members regarding any policy that may apply. In the case of prolonged illness or incapacity, the student should contact the Office of Student and Professional Life.

### Disability Accommodations 

For disability accommodation requests, contact the Elon Law [Registrar's Office](https://www.elon.edu/e/law/academics/registrar-office/index.html).  

### Honor Code 

The Law School [honor code](https://www.elon.edu/e/law/student-experience/honor-code.html) applies to all activities related to your law school study, including conduct during class and examinations.
