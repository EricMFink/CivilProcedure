# Question 1

## Issue: Does the Court have SMJ? 

Harold's only claim is based on the Susquehanna Unfair Trade Practices Act (SUTPA).

- This is a state statute.
- The only possible basis for SMJ is diversity of citizenship. 
	- There is nothing in the facts to suggest that disposition of the claim would involve any issue of federal law, so the _Grable_ test for Federal Question jurisdiction would not apply. 
	- Supplemental jurisdiction does not apply where the plaintiff asserts only a single claim against a single defendant. 

> 1 or more additional points for explaining the significance and constitutional foundations of SMJ. 

## Rule 

Diversity jurisdiction under sec. 1332 has two requirements: 

1. The plaintiff and defendant must be citizens of different states, and 
2. The amount in controversy between the parties must exceed $75,000. 

> 1 or more additional points for noting the differences between the constitutional grant of diversity jurisdiction (only requires minimal diversity) & the statutory requirements under sec. 1332 (complete diversity plus amount in controversy)

### Citizenship 

- Determined at time suit is filed & subsequent changes don't matter 
- Individual: Domicile 
	- State of residence with intent to remain indefinitely 
	- Indicia of intent: voter registration, taxes, etc. 
- Corporation: State of incorporation & principal place of business 
	- "Nerve center" test for PPB: Where high-level corporate decisions are made 
	- If state of incorp. & PPB are different, both count (i.e. neither can match an opposing party's state of citizenship)

## Amount in Controversy 

- Determined at the time the complaiint is filed. 
	- Doesn't matter if the plaintiff ends up recovering less than the statutory amount. 
- May be satisfied either based on the plaintiff's potential recovery or the cost to the defendant of complying with a judgment granting non-monetary relief  (e.g. injunction)
- A single plaintiff may aggregate the value of all claims against the same defendant.
- Damages for emotional distress, punitive damages, and attorney's fees will count toward the amount in controversy, as long as the governing law permits their recovery. 
- Legal certainty test
	- Court accepts the plaintiff's good faith allegation unless it is certain that the plaintiff could not recover more than $75,000 under the applicable law, e.g. if the law caps possible recovery at a lower amount. 
	- Where a party relies on a claim for attorney's fees to reach the jurisdictional amount, the court may assess whether the amount of fees is unduly speculative (Annie's Pooch Pops)

## Analysis 

### Citizenship 

- Harold is a citizen of California
	- He's lived there for 25 years and has only returned to Susquehanna twice in the past ten years 
	- On these facts, it is evident that Harold does not have any intent to remain in Susquehanna and that he has established domicile in California long before this case arose. 
- Whispering Glades is a citizen of Susquehanna
	- Incorporated there 
	- Sole place of business there 
- Since Harold & Whispering Glades are citizens of different states, the first requirement for diversity jurisdiction is satisfied. 

### Amount in Controversy 

- Harold's actual monetary loss is $500, i.e. the annual fees he paid for ground cover maintenance over the past five years, during which Whispering Glades did not maintain the ivy. 
	- The $5000 he initially paid for the burial plots doesn't count, because his claim only pertains to the annual maintenance, not to the burial plots themselves. 
- SUTPA permits the court to award up to three times the plaintiff's actual damages, so Harold could recover $1500 for his $500 monetary loss. 
- Harold also seeks damages for mental and emotional distress. 
	- It is questionable whether recovery of such damages is allowed under SUTPA
	- The statute permits suits by someone who "suffers any loss of money or property as a result of an unfair or deceptive act or practice" to "recover actual damages or one hundred dollars ($100), whichever is greater". 
	- This suggests that the "actual damages" recoverable under the statute are limited to "loss of money or property" and do not include non-economic harms such as mental or emotional distress. 
	- Assuming that's correct, than under the "legal certainty" test, Harold could not rely on damages for mental or emotional distress to reach the statutory amount in controversy. 
- Harold also seeks recovery of attorney's fees 
	- SUTPA does permit the court to award a successful plaintiff reasonable attorney's fees in addition to any damages. 
	- Assuming that SUTPA does not permit recovery of damages for mental or emotional distress, and assuming the court awards Harold $1500 in damages (i.e. three times his actual monetary loss), the attorney's fees would have to exceed $73,500 to bring the amount in controversy over the $75,000 threshold. 
	- The court would likely treat as unduly speculative a claim for attorney's fees that is nearly 50 times as much as the maximum possible damage award. Cf. Annie's Pooch Pops. 

## Conclusion 

The complete diversity requirement for SMJ under sec. 1332 is satisfied here. But the amount in controversy requirement is most likely not satisfied, unless it would be legally possible for Harold to recover more than $73,500 in damages for mental or emotional distress and/or attorney's fees. Assuming Harold cannot satisfy that requirement, the court lacks SMJ. 

# Question 2

## Issue: Choice of Law 

- In diversity cases, federal courts must apply state law as the "rules of decision", i.e. the rules governing substantive issues. But federal courts follow federal law on procedural matters. 

## Rule 

- There are two approaches to resolving state v. federal choice of law questions in diversity cases 
	- The REA/Hanna analysis applies where the FRCP is the source of the federal rule in question
	- The Erie analysis applies where federal common law or judicial custom is the source of the federal rule in question. 

### Erie 

- The RDA's requirement that federal courts in diversity cases follow state law applies only to substantive rules, i.e. rules that define the rights, duties, and liabilities of the parties. But for rules of procedure, federal courts follow federal law. 
- To distinguish between substantive and procedural rules, courts consider whether the difference between the state and federal rules would yield different outcomes, whether the application of federal rather than state rules would implicate the twin concerns of Erie, and whether there is any counterveiling federal interest in following federal rather than state rules. 
	- The outcome determinative test asks whether applying the federal rule rather than the state rule would yield a different outcome, e.g. the suit would be dismissed under the state rule but not under the federal rule. If so, the federal court should follow the state rule. 
	- Courts apply the outcome determinative test in light of the twin concerns of Erie: (1) discouraging forum shopping, and (2) avoding the inequitable administration of the laws. 
		- Applying the same rules in both federal and state court avoids the problem of parties forum shopping for more favorable outcomes in otherwise similar cases, which would impair the equal protection of law (because not all parties can bring their cases in federal court under diversity jurisdiction). 
	- But, where the federal rule or practice advances an important federal policy interest, the federal court may follow the federal rather than state rule, at least where doing so will not yield predictable and significant differences in outcome sufficient to implicate the twin concerns of Erie. See Byrd v. Blue Ridge. 

### REA/Hanna 

- If the federal rule in question comes from the FRCP, and if there is a true conflict between the federal and state rules, the federal court will follow the federal rule, even if it has some incidental effect on the outcome, as long as it is valid under the REA. 
- A true conflict exists where the federal and state rules have inconsistent provisions (i.e. it's not possible to follow both) or where the state rule imposes more stringent requirements. See, e.g. Hanna (state rule required personal service on the defendant; federal rule allowed both personal service on the defendant and service on any competent adult at the defendant's home or place of business)
- A rule is valid under the REA if it is adopted in accordance with the statutory process and does "not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive right"



# Question 3: Dimissal for Failure to State a Claim
