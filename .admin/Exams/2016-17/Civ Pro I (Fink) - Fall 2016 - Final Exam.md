In March 2015, Kristie Guidry signed her daughter up for ballet lessons at  Dance Dynasty studio, paying the $62.50 registration fee with a personal check. When Guidry wrote the check, she knew that her bank account was overdrawn. A week later, the bank returned the check for insufficient funds. Wendy Clare, a Dance Dynasty employee, contacted Guidry, informed her that the check had been returned, and asked her to make good on the check within two days. Guidry did not respond.  

In June 2015, attorney David B. Wilks, sent Guidry a letter asking her to pay her debt to Dance Dynasty. In the letter, Wilks explicitly stated that it was being sent in an effort to collect a debt, identified “Dance Enterprises, LLC, d/b/a Dance Dynasty” as the creditor, and identified the date and amount of the returned check. Guidry did not respond. 

In October 2015, American Recovery Agency (“ARA”), a debt recovery firm, sent Guidry a letter asking Guidry to pay her debt to Dance Dynasty. ARA’s letter explicitly stated that it was being sent in an effort to collect a debt, identified “Dance Enterprises, LLC, d/b/a Dance Dynasty” as the creditor, and identified the date and amount of the returned check. Guidry did not respond. 

In December 2015, Clare again called Guidry and requested payment of the $62.50 owed to Dance Dynasty. During the course of the call, Guidry falsely informed Clare that she believed she had already made good on her check. 

On January 1, 2016, after confirming that Guidry had not in fact made good on the check, Clare again telephoned Guidry. She informed Guidry that unless she paid her outstanding debt within 72 hours, she would seek a warrant for Guidry’s arrest. When Guidry failed to pay, Clare filed a criminal complaint for misdemeanor larceny by check. Under the applicable law, a person is guilty of larceny by check if (1) they write a check as payment for goods or services received, (2) they know when they write the check that their account has insufficient funds to cover the check, and (3) they fail to make good on the check within two days after being notified that the bank refused payment because of insufficient funds. 

In response to Clare’s complaint, an arrest warrant was issued for Guidry. On January 9, 2016, a police officer arrested Guidry on the warrant and took her to the police precinct for fingerprinting and processing. That procedure took about 20 minutes, at which point Guidry was released on her own recognizance.

In February 2016, Guidry, represented by attorney Rufus T. Firefly, appeared for trial on the misdemeanor larceny charge. Pursuant to an agreement with the prosecutor, Guidry paid $100 to Dance Dynasty, representing the amount owed for the returned check plus bank fees. The prosecutor then dismissed the charge. 

Angry over what she believed to be unfair treatment by Dance Dynasty and Clare, Guidry told Firefly she wanted to sue. “I don’t care about the money, it was only $100. But those bastards need to pay for humiliating me. I want to destroy their reputation and their business.”

Firefly’s law practice was limited to criminal defense. But he vaguely remembered learning about the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (”FDCPA”) (Attachment 1) in a consumer law course he took in law school. Firefly drafted a complaint (Attachment 2), which he filed in federal court on November 1, 2016.
 
On November 14, 2016, the defendants moved to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6). The motion asserted two grounds for dismissal: (1) that the allegations in the complaint did not state any violation of the FDCPA by either defendant, and (2) that “Dance Dynasty” was not a proper defendant, because it is merely the trade name of “Dance Enterprises, LLC”, the company that owns and operates the studio. 

At the same time, the defendants moved for sanctions pursuant to Rule 11, asserting that the FDCPA claims were frivilous, and that Guidry filed suit for an improper purpose. 

In response to the Defendants’ motions, Firefly drafted an amended complaint (Attachment 3), (1) removing Dance Dynasty as a defendant, (2) adding Dance Enterprises, LLC as a defendant, and (3) alleging additional facts in support of the FDCPA claims. On December 5, 2016, Firefly moved for leave to file the amended complaint. 

## Question 1

Should the court grant the plaintiff’s motion for leave to amend her complaint?  

## Question 2

Should the court grant the defendants’ motion for Rule 11 sanctions?
