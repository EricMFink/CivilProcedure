Re: Guy Mackendrick

This firm has been retained by Guy Mackendrick to represent him in a personal injury suit. Mackendrick was injured while attending a party at the office of Sterling Cooper, P.C., a New York advertising agency that handles advertising for Mackendrick’s business. During the party, a Sterling Cooper employee named Lois Sadler drove over Mackendrick’s foot with a John Deere riding lawnmower. 

As a result of this incident, Mackendrick has lost all of the toes on his left foot. He will require reconstructive surgery and extensive physical therapy. He has also experienced recurring nightmares about the incident, and has developed a morbid fear of garden tools, leaving him unable to enjoy his previous hobby of gardening. 

I would like you to draft a complaint for filing in federal court. For now, the complaint should assert only a single claim against Sadler for negligence. We may consider asserting additional claims and joining Sterling Cooper as an additional defendant at a later time. For your convenience, I am providing you with a copy of the firm’s document template for the complaint. I have already completed the caption and the jurisdictional statement. You should insert your name in the signature block where indicated.
