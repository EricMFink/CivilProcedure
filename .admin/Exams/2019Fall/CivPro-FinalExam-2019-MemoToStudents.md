Congratulations on completing your first term of law school. Reviewing your exams is a valuable part of the learning process. You can get your Civil Procedure exam from Janet Wright. To aid you in understanding what you did well, what you missed, and how you can improve on future exams, along with this memo I'm providing the exam questions, model answers and observations, and a self-assessment form. 

If you'd like to meet with me to discuss your exam, here is the procedure to follow: 

1. Make an appointment online (<https://calendly.com/emfink>).
2. Before our appointment, review your exam and **complete the self-assessment form**.
3. Send a copy of your completed self-assessment to me by email (<efink@elon.edu>) **at least 24 hours before your appointment**.
4. Bring your exam and self-assessment form with you to the appointment.
