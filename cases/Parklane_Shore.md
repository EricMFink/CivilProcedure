JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>
<p>This case presents the question whether a party who has had issues of fact adjudicated adversely to it in an equitable action may be collaterally estopped from relitigating the same issues before a jury in a subsequent legal action brought against it by a new party.</p>
<p>The respondent brought this stockholder's class action against the petitioners in a Federal District Court. The complaint alleged that the petitioners, Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. (Parklane), and 13 of its officers, directors, and stockholders, had issued a materially false and misleading proxy statement in connection with a merger.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[2]" name="r[2]" class="gsl_hash">[1]</a></sup> The proxy statement, according to the complaint, had violated §§ 14 (a), 10 (b), and 20 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 895, 891, 899, as amended, 15 U. S. C. §§ 78n (a), 78j (b), and 78t (a), as well as various rules and regulations promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The complaint sought damages, rescission of the merger, and recovery of costs.</p>
<p>Before this action came to trial, the SEC filed suit against the same defendants in the Federal District Court, alleging that the proxy statement that had been issued by Parklane was materially false and misleading in essentially the same respects as those that had ben alleged in the respondent's complaint. Injunctive relief was requested. After a 4-day <a class="gsl_pagenum" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p325">325</a><a class="gsl_pagenum2" id="p325" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p325">*325</a> trial, the District Court found that the proxy statement was materially false and misleading in the respects alleged, and entered a declaratory judgment to that effect. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6900694842976508873&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34"><i>SEC</i> v. <i>Parklane Hosiery Co.,</i> 422 F. Supp. 477</a>. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed this judgment. 558 F. 2d 1083.</p>
<p>The respondent in the present case then moved for partial summary judgment against the petitioners, asserting that the petitioners were collaterally estopped from relitigating the issues that had been resolved against them in the action brought by the SEC.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[3]" name="r[3]" class="gsl_hash">[2]</a></sup> The District Court denied the motion on the ground that such an application of collateral estoppel would deny the petitioners their Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed, holding that a party who has had issues of fact determined against him after a full and fair opportunity to litigate in a nonjury trial is collaterally estopped from obtaining a subsequent jury trial of these same issues of fact. 565 F. 2d 815. The appellate court concluded that "the Seventh Amendment preserves the right to jury trial only with respect to issues of fact, [and] once those issues have been fully and fairly adjudicated in a prior proceeding, nothing remains for trial, either with or without a jury." <i>Id.,</i> at 819. Because of an intercircuit conflict,<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[4]" name="r[4]" class="gsl_hash">[3]</a></sup> we granted certiorari. 435 U.

<p>The threshold question to be considered is whether, quite apart from the right to a jury trial under the Seventh Amendment, the petitioners can be precluded from relitigating facts resolved adversely to them in a prior equitable proceeding with another party under the general law of collateral estoppel. Specifically, we must determine whether a litigant who was not a party to a prior judgment may nevertheless use that judgment "offensively" to prevent a defendant from relitigating issues resolved in the earlier proceeding.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[5]" name="r[5]" class="gsl_hash">[4]</a></sup></p>

Under this mutuality doctrine, neither party could use a prior judgment <a class="gsl_pagenum" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p327">327</a><a class="gsl_pagenum2" id="p327" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p327">*327</a> as an estoppel against the other unless both parties were bound by the judgment.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[7]" name="r[7]" class="gsl_hash">[6]</a></sup> Based on the premise that it is somehow unfair to allow a party to use a prior judgment when he himself would not be so bound,<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[8]" name="r[8]" class="gsl_hash">[7]</a></sup> the mutuality requirement provided a party who had litigated and lost in a previous action an opportunity to relitigate identical issues with new parties.</p>

S., at 328</a>. The Court strongly suggested a negative answer to that question:</p>
<blockquote>"In any lawsuit where a defendant, because of the mutuality principle, is forced to present a complete defense on the merits to a claim which the plaintiff has fully litigated and lost in a prior action, there is an arguable misallocation of resources. To the extent the defendant in the second suit may not win by asserting, without contradiction, that the plaintiff had fully and fairly, but unsuccessfully, litigated the same claim in the prior suit, the defendant's time and money are diverted from alternative uses—productive or otherwise—to relitigation of a decided issue. And, still assuming that the issue was resolved correctly in the first suit, there is reason to be concerned about the plaintiff's allocation of resources. Permitting repeated litigation of the same issue as long as the supply of unrelated defendants holds out reflects either the aura of the gaming table or `a lack of discipline and of disinterestedness on the part of the lower courts, hardly a worthy or wise basis for fashioning rules of procedure.' <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=15862121130052860889&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34"><i>Kerotest Mfg.

<p>The <i>Blonder-Tongue</i> case involved defensive use of collateral estoppel—a plaintiff was estopped from asserting a claim that the plaintiff had previously litigated and lost against another defendant. The present case, by contrast, involves offensive use of collateral estoppel—a plaintiff is seeking to estop a defendant from relitigating the issues which the defendant previously litigated and lost against another plaintiff. In both the offensive and defensive use situations, the party against whom estoppel is asserted has litigated and lost in an earlier action. Nevertheless, several reasons have been advanced why the two situations should be treated differently.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[12]" name="r[12]" class="gsl_hash">[11]</a></sup></p>
<p>First, offensive use of collateral estoppel does not promote judicial economy in the same manner as defensive use does. Defensive use of collateral estoppel precludes a plaintiff from relitigating identical issues by merely "switching adversaries." <a class="gsl_co_link" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?about=7750489914717692755&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34"><i>Bernhard</i> v. <i>Bank of America Nat. Trust &amp; Savings Assn.,</i> 19 Cal. 2d, at 813, 122 P. 2d, at 895</a>.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[13]" name="r[13]" class="gsl_hash">[12]</a></sup> Thus defensive collateral estoppel gives a plaintiff a strong incentive to join <a class="gsl_pagenum" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p330">330</a><a class="gsl_pagenum2" id="p330" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p330">*330</a> all potential defendants in the first action if possible. Offensive use of collateral estoppel, on the other hand, creates precisely the opposite incentive. Since a plaintiff will be able to rely on a previous judgment against a defendant but will not be bound by that judgment if the defendant wins, the plaintiff has every incentive to adopt a "wait and see" attitude, in the hope that the first action by another plaintiff will result in a favorable judgment. <i>E. g., </i><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12959151965942316004&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34"><i>Nevarov</i> v. <i>Caldwell,</i> 161 Cal. App. 2d 762, 767-768, 327 P. 2d 111, 115</a>; <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=970690707747264691&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34"><i>Reardon</i> v. <i>Allen,</i> 88 N. J. Super. 560, 571-572, 213 A. 2d 26, 32</a>. Thus offensive use of collateral estoppel will likely increase rather than decrease the total amount of litigation, since potential plaintiffs will have everything to gain and nothing to lose by not intervening in the first action.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[14]" name="r[14]" class="gsl_hash">[13]</a></sup></p>
<p>A second argument against offensive use of collateral estoppel is that it may be unfair to a defendant. If a defendant in the first action is sued for small or nominal damages, he may have little incentive to defend vigorously, particularly if future suits are not foreseeable. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9953655731170628679&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34"><i>The Evergreens</i> v. <i>Nunan,</i> 141 F. 2d 927, 929 (CA2)</a>; cf. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5249386137154678923&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34"><i>Berner</i> v. <i>British Commonwealth Pac. Airlines,</i> 346 F. 2d 532 (CA2)</a> (application of offensive collateral estoppel denied where defendant did not appeal an adverse judgment awarding damages of $35,000 and defendant was later sued for over $7 million). Allowing offensive collateral estoppel may also be unfair to a defendant if the judgment relied upon as a basis for the estoppel is itself inconsistent with one or more previous judgments in favor of the defendant.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[15]" name="r[15]" class="gsl_hash">[14]</a></sup> Still another situation where it might be <a class="gsl_pagenum" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p331">331</a><a class="gsl_pagenum2" id="p331" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p331">*331</a> unfair to apply offensive estoppel is where the second action affords the defendant procedural opportunities unavailable in the first action that could readily cause a different result.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[16]" name="r[16]" class="gsl_hash">[15]</a></sup></p>
<p></p><h2>C</h2><p></p>
<p>We have concluded that the preferable approach for dealing with these problems in the federal courts is not to preclude the use of offensive collateral estoppel, but to grant trial courts broad discretion to determine when it should be applied.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[17]" name="r[17]" class="gsl_hash">[16]</a></sup> The general rule should be that in cases where a plaintiff could easily have joined in the earlier action or where, either for the reasons discussed above or for other reasons, the application of offensive estoppel would be unfair to a defendant, a trial judge should not allow the use of offensive collateral estoppel.</p>
<p>In the present case, however, none of the circumstances that might justify reluctance to allow the offensive use of collateral estoppel is present. The application of offensive collateral <a class="gsl_pagenum" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p332">332</a><a class="gsl_pagenum2" id="p332" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p332">*332</a> estoppel will not here reward a private plaintiff who could have joined in the previous action, since the respondent probably could not have joined in the injunctive action brought by the SEC even had he so desired.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[18]" name="r[18]" class="gsl_hash">[17]</a></sup> Similarly, there is no unfairness to the petitioners in applying offensive collateral estoppel in this case. First, in light of the serious allegations made in the SEC's complaint against the petitioners, as well as the foreseeability of subsequent private suits that typically follow a successful Government judgment, the petitioners had every incentive to litigate the SEC lawsuit fully and vigorously.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[19]" name="r[19]" class="gsl_hash">[18]</a></sup> Second, the judgment in the SEC action was not inconsistent with any previous decision. Finally, there will in the respondent's action be no procedural opportunities available to the petitioners that were unavailable in the first action of a kind that might be likely to cause a different result.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[20]" name="r[20]" class="gsl_hash">[19]</a></sup></p>
<p>We conclude, therefore, that none of the considerations that would justify a refusal to allow the use of offensive collateral estoppel is present in this case. Since the petitioners received a "full and fair" opportunity to litigate their claims in the <a class="gsl_pagenum" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p333">333</a><a class="gsl_pagenum2" id="p333" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p333">*333</a> SEC action, the contemporary law of collateral estoppel leads inescapably to the conclusion that the petitioners are collaterally estopped from relitigating the question of whether the proxy statement was materially false and misleading.</p>
<p></p><h2>II</h2><p></p>
<p>The question that remains is whether, notwithstanding the law of collateral estoppel, the use of offensive collateral estoppel in this case would violate the petitioners' Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[21]" name="r[21]" class="gsl_hash">[20]</a></sup></p>

<p>Recognition that an equitable determination could have collateral-estoppel effect in a subsequent legal action was the major premise of this Court's decision in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9636893879032116804&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34"><i>Beacon Theatres, Inc.</i> v. <i>Westover,</i> 359 U.

The defendant denied the allegations and counter-claimed for treble damages under the antitrust laws, requesting a trial by jury of the issues common to both the legal and equitable claims. The Court of Appeals upheld denial of the request, but this Court reversed, stating:</p>
<blockquote>"[T]he effect of the action of the District Court could be, as the Court of Appeals believed, `to limit the petitioner's opportunity fully to try to a jury every issue which has a bearing upon its treble damage suit,' for determination of the issue of clearances by the judge might `operate either by way of res judicata or collateral estoppel so as to conclude both parties with respect thereto at the subsequent trial of the treble damage claim.' " <i>Id.,</i> at 504.</blockquote>
<p>It is thus clear that the Court in the <i>Beacon Theatres</i> case thought that if an issue common to both legal and equitable claims was first determined by a judge, relitigation of the issue before a jury might be foreclosed by res judicata or collateral estoppel. To avoid this result, the Court held that when legal and equitable claims are joined in the same action, the trial judge has only limited discretion in determining the sequence of trial and "that discretion . . . must, wherever possible, be exercised to preserve jury trial." <i>Id.,</i> at 510.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[23]" name="r[23]" class="gsl_hash">[22]</a></sup></p>
<p>Both the premise of <i>Beacon Theatres,</i> and the fact that it enunciated no more than a general prudential rule were confirmed by this Court's decision in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9683721947005602171&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34"><i>Katchen</i> v. <i>Landy,</i> 382 U.

The Court stated:</p>
<blockquote>"Both <i>Beacon Theatres</i> and <i>Dairy Queen</i> recognize that there might be situations in which the Court could proceed to resolve the equitable claim first even though the results might be dispositive of the issues involved in the legal claim." <i>Id.,</i> at 339.</blockquote>
<p>Thus the Court in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9683721947005602171&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34"><i>Katchen</i> v. <i>Landy</i></a> recognized that an equitable determination can have collateral-estoppel effect in a subsequent legal action and that this estoppel does not violate the Seventh Amendment.</p>
<p></p><h2>B</h2><p></p>
<p>Despite the strong support to be found both in history and in the recent decisional law of this Court for the proposition that an equitable determination can have collateral-estoppel effect in a subsequent legal action, the petitioners argue that application of collateral estoppel in this case would nevertheless violate their Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial. The petitioners contend that since the scope of the Amendment must be determined by reference to the common law as it existed in 1791, and since the common law permitted collateral estoppel only where there was mutuality of parties, collateral estoppel cannot constitutionally be applied when such mutuality is absent.</p>
<p>The petitioners have advanced no persuasive reason, however, why the meaning of the Seventh Amendment should depend on whether or not mutuality of parties is present. A litigant who has lost because of adverse factual findings in an equity action is equally deprived of a jury trial whether he is estopped from relitigating the factual issues against the same party or a new party. In either case, the party against whom estoppel is asserted has litigated questions of fact, and has had the facts determined against him in an earlier proceeding. <a class="gsl_pagenum" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p336">336</a><a class="gsl_pagenum2" id="p336" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p336">*336</a> In either case there is no further factfinding function for the jury to perform, since the common factual issues have been resolved in the previous action.

<p>The Seventh Amendment has never been interpreted in the rigid manner advocated by the petitioners. On the contrary, many procedural devices developed since 1791 that have diminished the civil jury's historic domain have been found not to be inconsistent with the Seventh Amendment.

<p>The <i>Galloway</i> case is particularly instructive. There the party against whom a directed verdict had been entered argued that the procedure was unconstitutional under the Seventh Amendment. In rejecting this claim, the Court said:</p>
<blockquote>"The Amendment did not bind the federal courts to the exact procedural incidents or details of jury trial according <a class="gsl_pagenum" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p337">337</a><a class="gsl_pagenum2" id="p337" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p337">*337</a> to the common law in 1791, any more than it tied them to the common-law system of pleading or the specific rules of evidence then prevailing. Nor were `the rules of the common law' then prevalent, including those relating to the procedure by which the judge regulated the jury's role on questions of fact, crystallized in a fixed and immutable system. . . .</blockquote>
<blockquote>"The more logical conclusion, we think, and the one which both history and the previous decisions here support, is that the Amendment was designed to preserve the basic institution of jury trial in only its most fundamental elements, not the great mass of procedural forms and details, varying even then so widely among common-law jurisdictions." <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8440594439336972972&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34">319 U. S., at 390, 392</a> (footnote omitted).</blockquote>
<p>The law of collateral estoppel, like the law in other procedural areas defining the scope of the jury's function, has evolved since 1791. Under the rationale of the <i>Galloway</i> case, these developments are not repugnant to the Seventh Amendment simply for the reason that they did not exist in 1791. Thus if, as we have held, the law of collateral estoppel forecloses the petitioners from relitigating the factual issues determined against them in the SEC action, nothing in the Seventh Amendment dictates a different result, even though because of lack of mutuality there would have been no collateral estoppel in 1791.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[25]" name="r[25]" class="gsl_hash">[24]</a></sup></p>

<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>
<p>MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, dissenting.</p>
<p>It is admittedly difficult to be outraged about the treatment accorded by the federal judiciary to petitioners' demand for a jury trial in this lawsuit. Outrage is an emotion all but <a class="gsl_pagenum" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p338">338</a><a class="gsl_pagenum2" id="p338" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p338">*338</a> impossible to generate with respect to a corporate defendant in a securities fraud action, and this case is no exception. But the nagging sense of unfairness as to the way petitioners have been treated, engendered by the <i>imprimatur</i> placed by the Court of Appeals on respondent's "heads I win, tails you lose" theory of this litigation, is not dispelled by this Court's antiseptic analysis of the issues in the case. It may be that if this Nation were to adopt a new Constitution today, the Seventh Amendment guaranteeing the right of jury trial in civil cases in federal courts would not be included among its provisions. But any present sentiment to that effect cannot obscure or dilute our obligation to enforce the Seventh Amendment, which <i>was</i> included in the Bill of Rights in 1791 and which has not since been repealed in the only manner provided by the Constitution for repeal of its provisions.</p>
<p>The right of trial by jury in civil cases at common law is fundamental to our history and jurisprudence. Today, however, the Court reduces this valued right, which Blackstone praised as "the glory of the English law," to a mere "neutral" <a class="gsl_pagenum" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p339">339</a><a class="gsl_pagenum2" id="p339" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p339">*339</a> factor and in the name of procedural reform denies the right of jury trial to defendants in a vast number of cases in which defendants, heretofore, have enjoyed jury trials. Over 35 years ago, Mr. Justice Black lamented the "gradual process of judicial erosion which in one-hundred-fifty years has slowly worn away a major portion of the essential guarantee of the Seventh Amendment." <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8440594439336972972&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34"><i>Galloway</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 319 U.

<p></p><h2>A</h2><p></p>
<p>It is perhaps easy to forget, now more than 200 years removed from the events, that the right of trial by jury was held in such esteem by the colonists that its deprivation at the hands of the English was one of the important grievances leading to the break with England. See Sources and Documents Illustrating the American Revolution 1764-1788 and the Formation of the Federal Constitution 94 (S. Morison 2d ed. 1929); R. Pound, The Development of Constitutional Guarantees of Liberty 69-72 (1957); C. Ubbelohde, The Vice-Admiralty Courts and the American Revolution 208-211 (1960). The extensive use of vice-admiralty courts by colonial administrators to eliminate the colonists' right of jury trial was listed among the specific offensive English acts denounced in the Declaration of Independence.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[28]" name="r[28]" class="gsl_hash">[3]</a></sup> And after <a class="gsl_pagenum" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p341">341</a><a class="gsl_pagenum2" id="p341" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p341">*341</a> war had broken out, all of the 13 newly formed States restored the institution of civil jury trial to its prior prominence; 10 expressly guaranteed the right in their state constitutions and the 3 others recognized it by statute or by common practice.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[29]" name="r[29]" class="gsl_hash">[4]</a></sup> Indeed, "[t]he right to trial by jury was probably the only one universally secured by the first American state constitutions . . . ."

<p>One might justly wonder then why no mention of the right of jury trial in civil cases should have found its way into the Constitution that emerged from the Philadelphia Convention in 1787. Article III, § 2, cl. 3, merely provides that "The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury." The omission of a clause protective of the civil jury right was not for lack of trying, however. Messrs. Pinckney and Gerry proposed to provide a clause securing the right of jury trial in civil cases, but their efforts failed.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[31]" name="r[31]" class="gsl_hash">[6]</a></sup> Several reasons <a class="gsl_pagenum" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p342">342</a><a class="gsl_pagenum2" id="p342" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p342">*342</a> have been advanced for this failure. The Federalists argued that the practice of civil juries among the several States varied so much that it was too difficult to draft constitutional language to accommodate the different state practices.

<p>The virtually complete absence of a bill of rights in the proposed Constitution was the principal focus of the Anti-Federalists' attack on the Constitution, and the lack of a provision for civil juries featured prominently in their arguments.

<p>The foregoing sketch is meant to suggest what many of those who oppose the use of juries in civil trials seem to ignore.

For to sanction creation of procedural devices which limit the province of the jury to a greater degree than permitted at common law in 1791 is in direct contravention of the Seventh Amendment. See <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16361306368950068443&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34"><i>Neely</i> v. <i>Martin K. Eby Constr. Co.,</i> 386 U.

And since we deal here not with the common law <i>qua</i> common law but with the Constitution, no amount of argument that the device provides for more efficiency or more accuracy or is fairer will save it if the degree of invasion of the jury's province is greater than allowed in 1791.

<p>The guarantees of the Seventh Amendment will prove burdensome in some instances; the civil jury surely was a burden to the English governors who, in its stead, substituted the vice-admiralty court.

<p></p><h2>C</h2><p></p>
<p>Judged by the foregoing principles, I think it is clear that petitioners were denied their Seventh Amendment right to a <a class="gsl_pagenum" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p347">347</a><a class="gsl_pagenum2" id="p347" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p347">*347</a> jury trial in this case. Neither respondent nor the Court doubts that at common law as it existed in 1791, petitioners would have been entitled in the private action to have a jury determine whether the proxy statement was false and misleading in the respects alleged. The reason is that at common law in 1791, collateral estoppel was permitted only where the parties in the first action were identical to, or in privity with, the parties to the subsequent action.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[38]" name="r[38]" class="gsl_hash">[13]</a></sup> It was not until 1971 that the doctrine of mutuality was abrogated by this Court in certain limited circumstances. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6860254007903008441&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34"><i>Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc.</i> v. <i>University of Illinois Foundation,</i> 402 U. S. 313</a>.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[39]" name="r[39]" class="gsl_hash">[14]</a></sup> But developments in the judge-made doctrine of collateral estoppel, however salutary, cannot, consistent with the Seventh Amendment, contract in any material fashion the right to a jury trial that a defendant would have enjoyed in 1791. In the instant case, resort to the doctrine of collateral estoppel does more than merely contract the right to a jury trial: It eliminates the right entirely and therefore contravenes the Seventh Amendment.</p>
<p>The Court responds, however, that at common law "a litigant was not entitled to have a jury [in a subsequent action at law between the same parties] determine issues that had been previously adjudicated by a chancellor in equity," and that "petitioners have advanced no persuasive reason . . . why the meaning of the Seventh Amendment should depend on <a class="gsl_pagenum" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p348">348</a><a class="gsl_pagenum2" id="p348" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p348">*348</a> whether or not mutuality of parties is present." <i>Ante,</i> at 333, 335. But that is tantamount to saying that since a party would not be entitled to a jury trial if he brought an equitable action, there is no persuasive reason why he should receive a jury trial on virtually the same issues if instead he chooses to bring his lawsuit in the nature of a legal action. The persuasive reason is that the Seventh Amendment requires that a party's right to jury trial which existed at common law be "preserved" from incursions by the government or the judiciary. Whether this Court believes that use of a jury trial in a particular instance is necessary, or fair or repetitive is simply irrelevant. If that view is "rigid," it is the Constitution which commands that rigidity. To hold otherwise is to rewrite the Seventh Amendment so that a party is guaranteed a jury trial in civil cases unless this Court thinks that a jury trial would be inappropriate.</p>
<p>No doubt parallel "procedural reforms" could be instituted in the area of criminal jurisprudence, which would accomplish much the same sort of expedition of court calendars and conservation of judicial resources as would the extension of collateral estoppel in civil litigation. Government motions for summary judgment, or for a directed verdict in favor of the prosecution at the close of the evidence, would presumably save countless hours of judges' and jurors' time. It can scarcely be doubted, though, that such "procedural reforms" would not survive constitutional scrutiny under the jury trial guarantee of the Sixth Amendment. Just as the principle of separation of powers was not incorporated by the Framers into the Constitution in order to promote efficiency or dispatch in the business of government, the right to a jury trial was not guaranteed in order to facilitate prompt and accurate decision of lawsuits. The essence of that right lies in its insistence that a body of laymen not permanently attached to the sovereign participate along with the judge in the factfinding <a class="gsl_pagenum" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p349">349</a><a class="gsl_pagenum2" id="p349" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p349">*349</a> necessitated by a lawsuit. And that essence is as much a part of the Seventh Amendment's guarantee in civil cases as it is of the Sixth Amendment's guarantee in criminal prosecutions.

Similarly, the modern device of summary judgment was found not to violate the Seventh Amendment because in 1791 a demurrer to the evidence, a procedural device substantially similar to summary judgment, was a common practice. <i>E. g., </i><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3680723930534574516&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34"><i>Pawling</i> v. <i>United States,</i> 4 Cranch 219, 221-222 (1808)</a>.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[41]" name="r[41]" class="gsl_hash">[16]</a></sup> <a class="gsl_pagenum" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p350">350</a><a class="gsl_pagenum2" id="p350" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p350">*350</a> The procedural devices of summary judgment and directed verdict are direct descendants of their common-law antecedents.

And while at common law there apparently was no practice of setting aside a verdict in part,<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[42]" name="r[42]" class="gsl_hash">[17]</a></sup> the Court in <i>Gasoline Products</i> permitted a partial retrial of "distinct and separable" issues because the change in procedure would not impair the substance of the right to jury trial. <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5688289684861979233&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34">283 U.

<p>By contrast, the development of nonmutual estoppel is a substantial departure from the common law and its use in this case completely deprives petitioners of their right to have a jury determine contested issues of fact. I am simply unwilling to accept the Court's presumption that the complete extinguishment of petitioners' right to trial by jury can be justified as a mere change in "procedural incident or detail." Over 40 years ago, Mr. Justice Sutherland observed in a not dissimilar case: "[T]his court in a very special sense is charged with the duty of construing and upholding the Constitution; and in the discharge of that important duty, it ever must be alert to see that a doubtful precedent be not extended by mere analogy to a different case if the result will be to weaken or subvert what it conceives to be a principle of the fundamental law of the land." <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=11713071400860936772&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34"><i>Dimick</i> v. <i>Schiedt,</i> 293 U.

<p>Even accepting, <i>arguendo,</i> the majority's position that there is no violation of the Seventh Amendment here, I nonetheless would not sanction the use of collateral estoppel in this case. The Court today holds:</p>
<blockquote>"The general rule should be that in cases where a plaintiff could easily have joined in the earlier action or where, either for the reasons discussed above or for other reasons, the application of offensive estoppel would be unfair to a defendant, a trial judge should not allow the use of offensive collateral estoppel." <i>Ante,</i> at 331.</blockquote>
<p>In my view, it is "unfair" to apply offensive collateral estoppel where the party who is sought to be estopped has not had an opportunity to have the facts of his case determined by a jury. Since in this case petitioners were not entitled to a jury trial in the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) lawsuit,<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[43]" name="r[43]" class="gsl_hash">[18]</a></sup> I would not estop them from relitigating the issues determined in the SEC suit before a jury in the private action. I believe that several factors militate in favor of this result.</p>
<p>First, the use of offensive collateral estoppel in this case runs counter to the strong federal policy favoring jury trials, even if it does not, as the majority holds, violate the Seventh Amendment. The Court's decision in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9636893879032116804&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34"><i>Beacon Theatres, Inc.</i> v. <i>Westover,</i> 359 U.

In <i>Beacon Theatres</i> the Court held that where both equitable and legal claims or defenses are presented in a single case, "only under the most imperative circumstances, circumstances which in view of the flexible procedures of the Federal Rules we cannot now anticipate, can the right to a jury trial of legal issues be lost through prior determination of equitable claims." <a class="gsl_pagenum" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p352">352</a><a class="gsl_pagenum2" id="p352" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p352">*352</a> <i>Id.,</i> at 510-511.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[44]" name="r[44]" class="gsl_hash">[19]</a></sup> And in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=18271247949553848045&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34"><i>Jacob</i> v. <i>New York,</i> 315 U.

<p>Second, I believe that the opportunity for a jury trial in the second action could easily lead to a different result from that obtained in the first action before the court and therefore that it is unfair to estop petitioners from relitigating the issues before a jury. This is the position adopted in the Restatement (Second) of Judgments, which disapproves of the application of offensive collateral estoppel where the defendant has an opportunity for a jury trial in the second lawsuit that was not available in the first action.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[47]" name="r[47]" class="gsl_hash">[22]</a></sup> The Court accepts the proposition that it is unfair to apply offensive collateral estoppel "where the second action affords the defendant procedural opportunities unavailable in the first action that could readily cause a different result." <i>Ante,</i> at 331. Differences in discovery opportunities between the two actions are cited as examples of situations where it would be unfair to permit offensive collateral estoppel. <i>Ante,</i> at 331 n. 15. But in the Court's view, the fact that petitioners would have been entitled to a jury trial in the present action is not such a "procedural opportunit[y]" because "the presence or absence of a jury as factfinder is basically <i>neutral,</i> quite unlike, for example, the <a class="gsl_pagenum" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p354">354</a><a class="gsl_pagenum2" id="p354" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p354">*354</a> necessity of defending the first lawsuit in an inconvenient forum." <i>Ante,</i> at 332 n. 19 (emphasis added).</p>
<p>As is evident from the prior brief discussion of the development of the civil jury trial guarantee in this country, those who drafted the Declaration of Independence and debated so passionately the proposed Constitution during the ratification period, would indeed be astounded to learn that the presence or absence of a jury is merely "neutral," whereas the availability of discovery, a device unmentioned in the Constitution, may be controlling. It is precisely because the Framers believed that they might receive a different result at the hands of a jury of their peers than at the mercy of the sovereign's judges, that the Seventh Amendment was adopted. And I suspect that anyone who litigates cases before juries in the 1970's would be equally amazed to hear of the supposed lack of distinction between trial by court and trial by jury. The Court can cite no authority in support of this curious proposition. The merits of civil juries have been long debated, but I suspect that juries have never been accused of being merely "neutral" factors.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[48]" name="r[48]" class="gsl_hash">[23]</a></sup></p>

<p>The ultimate irony of today's decision is that its potential for significantly conserving the resources of either the litigants or the judiciary is doubtful at best. That being the case, I see absolutely no reason to frustrate so cavalierly the important federal policy favoring jury decisions of disputed fact questions. The instant case is an apt example of the minimal savings that will be accomplished by the Court's decision. As the Court admits, even if petitioners are collaterally estopped from relitigating whether the proxy was materially false and misleading, they are still entitled to have a jury determine whether respondent was injured by the alleged misstatements and the amount of damages, if any, sustained by respondent. <i>Ante,</i> at 325 n. 2.

The time saved by not trying the issue of whether the proxy was materially false and misleading before the jury is likely to be insubstantial.<sup><a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#[49]" name="r[49]" class="gsl_hash">[24]</a></sup> It is just as probable that today's decision will have the result of coercing defendants to agree to consent orders or settlements <a class="gsl_pagenum" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p356">356</a><a class="gsl_pagenum2" id="p356" href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7479573211945418487&amp;q=parklane+hosiery+co+v+shore&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,34#p356">*356</a> in agency enforcement actions in order to preserve their right to jury trial in the private actions.

The problem of unfairness is particularly acute in cases of offensive estoppel, however, because the defendant against whom estoppel is asserted typically will not have chosen the forum in the first action.

Collateral estoppel does not involve the "re-examination" of any fact decided by a jury. On the contrary, the whole premise of collateral estoppel is that once an issue has been resolved in a prior proceeding, there is no further factfinding function to be performed.</p>

</p><p>"Were there any doubt about the [question whether the petitioners were entitled to a jury redetermination of the issues otherwise subject to collateral estoppel] it should in any event be resolved against the defendants in this case for the reason that, although they were fully aware of the pendency of the present suit throughout the non-jury trial of the SEC case, they made no effort to protect their right to a jury trial of the damage claims asserted by plaintiffs, either by seeking to expedite trial of the present action or by requesting Judge Duffy, in the exercise of his discretion pursuant to Rule 39 (b), (c), F.R.Civ.P., to order that the issues in the SEC case be tried by a jury or before an advisory jury." 565 F. 2d, at 821-822. (Footnote omitted.)</p>
<p>The Court of Appeals was mistaken in these suggestions. The petitioners did not have a right to a jury trial in the equitable injunctive action brought by the SEC. Moreover, an advisory jury, which might have only delayed and complicated that proceeding, would not in any event have been a Seventh Amendment jury. And the petitioners were not in a position to expedite the private action and stay the SEC action.

Thus, even though the plaintiffs in <i>Meeker</i> had received a "full and fair" opportunity to try the common issues in the prior equitable action, they nonetheless were given the opportunity to retry those issues before a jury. Today's decision is totally inconsistent with <i>Meeker</i> and the Court fails to explain this inconsistency.</p>
