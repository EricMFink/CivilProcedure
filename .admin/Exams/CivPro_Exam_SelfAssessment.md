### Organization 

Organization is an important aspect of all legal writing, including law school exams. A well organized answer will help ensure that your answer is complete and make it easier for your reader to follow your analysis.

The organization of an exam answer (or any other form of legal writing) may vary depending on the nature and complexity of the question or issue(s) at hand. But generally, the "IRAC" model and its variants provide an effective and efficient format. At a minimum, a good answer must include a statement and explanaton of the rule (R) and an analysis applying the rule to the facts in the question (A). Where the question itself specifies the main issue (as in this exam), you might omit the issue statement and start with the rule. For this exam, a separate conclusion (C) wasn't necessary. 

##### In the left margin of your exam, for each question, write an "I" next to your Issue statement, an "R" next to your rule statement, an "A" next your your analysis, and a "C" next to your conclusion. Are any of your answers missing a rule statement or analysis?

##### For questions that involve multiple issues or sub-issues, did you organize your answer accordingly? Are there any issues/sub-issues you overlooked? Are there any for which you did not provide a clear rule statement and analysis?
