# Questions 

1. In which of the following cases would a federal court have diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. § 1332 (assuming all claims arise under state law)? 
	a. Abel (VA) sues Baker (NC), Charlie (TN), Davis (VA), and Edwards (SC), for breach of contract arising out of a real estate deal among the five parties. Under the applicable state law and the contract terms, the defendants are jointly and severally liable for the alleged breach. Abel seeks $80,000 in damages. 
	b. Betty (NC) sues Dupree (VA) seeking $50,000 in damages for fraud, alleging that a diamond ring Dupree sold her was really made of glass. In the same action, Betty also asserts an unrelated negligence claim against Dupree, seeking $50,000 for property damage and personal injuries she sustained when a drunken Dupree crashed into Betty's car. 
	c. Neff (CA) is in possession of a painting valued at $75,000. Pennoyer (OR) sues Neff, to recover the painting, which he claims Neff borrowed but failed to return as promised. 
	d. None of the above.  

2. Perry (NC) has a homeowner's insurance policy from Dependable Ins. Co. (DE), which he bought through a local agent, Delilah (NC). Perry submits a claim for coverage after a broken water main under his front yard results in property damage costing $50,000 to repair. Dependable denies the claim, asserting that the policy does not cover "flood damage". Perry sues Dependable for breach of contract & bad faith denial of an insurance claim under state law. He seeks $50,000 in compensatory damages and another $50,000 in punitive damages. If Perry files in DE state court, may Dependable remove to federal court? 
	a. Yes, provided state law would allow recovery of punitive damages. 
	b. Yes, if Dependable raises a defense based on federal law. 
	c. No, because Delilah, the Dependable agent who sold the policy, is a citizen of NC. 
	d. No, because it's uncertain whether Perry will recover punitive damages. 

N.B. Answer D should be "None of the above". This is the correct answer. 

3. While Goldilocks (NC) is visiting her Grandmother (VA), Wolf (NC) breaks into Grandmother's house and devours her. Goldilocks manages to escape before Wolf has her for dessert. Goldilocks is named executor of Grandmother's estate. In her representative capacity as executor, Goldilocks brings a wrongful death action in federal court against Wolf on behalf of Grandmother's estate, seeking $100,000 in damages. In the same suit, Goldilocks also asserts her own emotional distress claim against Wolf, seeking $25,000 in damages. Which of the following is correct?  
	a. The court has have diversity jurisdiction over both claims. 
	b. The court has diversity jurisdiction over the wrongful death claim and supplemental jurisdiction over the emotional distress claim. 
	c. The court has diversity jurisdiction over the wrongful death claim, but must remand the emotional distress claim to state court. 
	d. The court must dismiss both claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. 

4. Neff (CA) visits Oregon and is astonished to find a house on a parcel of land that Neff had purchased some years earlier from Mitchell (WA). After some investigation, Neff learns that the house was built and is currently occupied by Pennoyer (OR), who claims to have purchased the land from Mitchell. Neff brings a quiet title action in federal court against Pennoyer, seeking a declaratory judgment that Neff is the sole rightful owner of the property, which is valued at $100,000. Under state law, Pennoyer may, in the same action, assert his own claim (a "third-party claim") against Mitchell to recover $80,000 for breach of contract & fraud in the event the court decides the quiet title claim in favor of Neff. Under federal law, specifically Rule 14 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Pennoyer may not assert this type of third-party claim; instead he would have to bring a separate action against Mitchell following the outcome of the quiet title suit. Which law should the federal court apply to each issue? 
	a. State law, because it is in direct conflict with federal law. 
	b. FRCP Rule 14, if the court determines that it advances an important federal interest. 
	c. FRCP Rule 14, regardless of the rationale behind it. 
	d. Whichever the court determines is most equitable and efficient.  

5. In which of the following instances must a federal court apply state law, rather than federal law, in a diversity case)? 
	a. Under state law, a plaintiff seeking a preliminary injunction must prove _both_ that it will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is denied _and_ that this harm outweighs any harm to the defendant if the injunction is granted. In federal court, the plaintiff has the burden of it will suffer irreparable harm if the injunction is denied; the defendant then has the burden of proving it will suffer greater harm if the injunction is granted. 
	b. Under state law, a plaintiff asserting a claim for breach of a written contract must attach a copy of the contract to the complaint. FRCP Rule 8 merely requires that the complaint contain "a short and plain statement of the claim"; production of the written contract happens during the discovery process under FRCP Rule 26 and 34. 
	c. Under state law, before a civil suit may proceed to trial, the parties must participate in a court-supervised mediation process. Under federal law, mediation is voluntary and requires the agreement of all parties. 
	d. All of the above.
