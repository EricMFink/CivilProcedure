# Compulsory Party Joinder

## Identifying a Required Party

#### Rule 19(a): Persons Required to be Joined if Feasible

> (1) A person who is subject to service of process and whose joinder will not deprive the court of subject-matter jurisdiction must be joined if:
>
> (a) in that person’s absence, the court cannot accord complete relief among existing parties; or(b) that person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that disposing of the action in the person’s presence may:(i) as a practical matter impair or impede the person’s ability to protect the interest; or(ii) leave an existing party subject to a substantial risk of incurring double, multiple, or otherwise inconsistent obligations because of the interest.

Examples of required parties under Rule 19(a):

- Parties to contract, where suit seeks to void the contract
- Joint owners of property in dispute

#### Torrington Co. v. Yost (D.S.C. 1991)

- Facts & Procedural History
	- Yost, an employee of Torrington Co., signed a non-disclosure agreement
	- Yost went to work for competitor, INA Bearing Co.
	- Torrington Sought injunction and damages based on non-disclosure agreement
- Issue
	- Whether INA is an indispensible party under Rule 19
		- Joining INA as a defendant would defeat diversity (both are Del. Corps.)
- Analysis
	- Because Torrington seeks injunction to prohibit Yost from working for any competitor, INA’s interest would be directly affected
	- If court grants injunction limiting the type of work Yost can do, he could face inconsistent obligations
		- Limits imposed by judgment
		- Terms of employment with INA
	- Not clear that problems can be addressed through protective provisions or limiting scope of injunction
		- Yost and INA might still be prejudiced
		- Without INA as a party, a judgment in favor of Torrington may be inadequate to protect its interests
	- Another (state court) is available in which Torrington can join both parties

#### Temple v. Synthes Corp. (US 1990)

- Joint tortfeasers are not “necessary” parties
  - Possibility of inconsistent verdicts in separate actions is not grounds for compulsory joinder under Rule 19
  - Judicial economy alone is not grounds for compulsory joinder under Rule 19
- Could Synthes have impleaded the doctor & hospital under Rule 14(a)? Why or why not?

#### Wilbur v. Locke (9th Cir. 2005)

- Tribal members sue State to void contract providing for tribal cigarette tax in lieu of state tax
- Tribe is necessary party
	- Party to contract, so interest would impair interest
- Joinder of tribe not feasible because of sovereign immunity
	- 1st 3 factors weigh in favor of dismissal
	- 4th factor weighs against dismissal, but doesn’t outweigh others

## Feasibility of Joinder:

- Court has personal jurisdiction over party to be joined (party to be joined may waive objection)
- Joinder will not defeat subject-matter jurisdiction (diversity)
- Party to be joined has no valid objection to venue (party to be joined may waive objection)

#### Rule 19(b): When Joinder Is Not Feasible

- Remedy: Dismissal
	- “Equity and good conscience” – i.e. discretion of court
- Factors:
	- Extent to which judgment without missing party would prejudice missing or existing parties
	- Extent to which prejudice can be mitigated or avoided by:
		- protective provisions in the judgment
		- shaping of relief
		- other measures
	- Whether court can grant adequate remedy without the missing party
	- Whether plaintiff would be left without adequate remedy if case is dismissed

#### Provident Tradesmens Bank & Trust Co. v. Patterson (US 1968)

- Facts
	- Case arises out of automobile accident
		- Estate of Lynch (passenger in 1st car) v. Estate of Cionci (driver of 1st car)
			- Federal court has diversity jurisdiction
		- Estate of Smith (driver of 2nd car) v. Cionci (driver of 1st car), Dutcher (owner of 1st car), & Estate of Lynch
			- Why sue Estate of Lynch? I have no idea!
		- Harris (passenger in 1st car) v. Cionci, Dutcher, & Estate of Lynch
	- Declaratory judgment action by Estate of Lynch against insurance company
		- Estate settled claim against Cionci, but could not collect from his estate
		- Plaintiff sought declaration that insured owner of car had authorized driver to use the car
			- Coverage depended upon authorization
		- Insurance company argues that car owner is an indispensible party, and that plaintiff’s failure to join owner means case must be dismissed
			- Joinder of owner as defendant would have destroyed diversity
		- Two other cases against owner, brought by estates of other passengers killed in the accident, were pending in state court

- Holding & Analysis 
	- Owner  was not an indispensible party, whose non-joinder required dismissal
	- Court notes procedural posture: issue not raised until appeal
		- Issue is not waived: Rule 12(b)(7)
	- But Rule 19(b) factors must be evaluated in light of the current posture of the case & the parties’ interests at this point
		- Why? Because insurance company waited until now to raise the issue. Court is concerned about prejudice to Plaintiff. 
	- Court of Appeals concluded owner had an “adverse interest” under  “Dead Man’s Rule” and therefore was interested party for purposes of Rule 19.
		- “Dead Man’s Rule”: Party to oral contract may not testify against adverse party if the latter is dead”
	- But owner would not be bound by judgment against insurance company
		- Can assert lack of authorization in the other suits against him, so that he may get benefit of insurance coverage on judgments in those cases.

## Inconsistent Obligations:

#### American Ins. Co. v. St. Jude Medical, Inc., 597 F.Supp.2d 973 (D.MN, 2009)

- “Inconsistent obligations, however, are distinct from inconsistent adjudications or results. Obligations are inconsistent if ‘a party is unable to comply with one court’s order without breaching another court’s order concerning the same incident. Inconsistent adjudications or results, by contrast, occur when a defendant successfully defends a claim in one forum, yet loses on another claim arising from the same incident in another forum.’ Delgado v. Plaza Las Americas, Inc., 139 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1998). Rule 19(a)(1)(B)(ii) is not concerned with inconsistent adjudications. See Sykes v. Hengel, 220 F.R.D. 593, 597 (S.D. Iowa 2004); see also RPR & Assocs. v. O’Brien/Atkins Assocs., 921 F.Supp. 1457, 1464 (M.D.N.C.1995) (‘Rule 19 is not triggered by the possibility of a subsequent adjudication that may result in a judgment that is inconsistent as a matter of logic.’).”

#### Helzberg’s Diamond Shops v. Valley West Des Moines Shopping Ctr. (8th Cir 1977)

- Helzberg sues Valley West for violating exclusivity provision in lease
- Other retailer is not a necessary party—their rights won’t be determined
- Valley West might face inconsistent obligations, but that’s their own fault

# Intervention

## Intervention as of right

##### Rule 24(a)

- Requirements
	- 24(a)(1) -- Right granted by federal statute, or
	- 24(a)(2) --
		- Claims an interest in property or transaction that is subject of action, and
		- Interest would be impaired if action proceeds without intervenor
			- unless adequately represented by existing party
- Not mandatory
	- Non-Party opting not to intervene, where they could have as of right, is not subject to res judicata/collateral estoppel. Martin v. Wilks (US 1989)
	- Only mandatory if the conditions under Rule 19 apply


#### Grutter v. Bollinger (6th Cir. 1999)

- Facts & Procedural History
	- African-American applicants to University of Michigan, and group supporting affirmative action, sought to intervene in suit by white applicants challenging University’s affirmative action practices
- Issue
	- Whether intervenor’s have a substantial interest that would not adequately be represented by University
- Analysis
	- Intervenors have interest in maintaining the use of race as a factor in admissions
		- Rule 24(a)(2) does not require “a specific legal or equitable interest”
	- Interest may be impaired
		- Access for minority applicants might be impaired if plaintiffs win
	- Adequacy of representation
		- University potentially has different interests
			- Might to present evidence of past discrimination, or evidence of disparate impacts of admissions criteria 

#### Smuck v. Hobson (DC Cir. 1969)

- Facts & Procedural History
	- Class action against DC school district for depriving black & poor students equal educational opportunity
	- District Court rules in favor of plaintiff
	- School Board opts not to appeal
	- Parties seeking to intervene for purpose of pursuing appeal: 
		- Former school superintendent and dissenting school board member
		- Parents who disagree with decision
- Holding & Analysis
	- Former superintendent & dissenting board member may not intervene, where they lack a sufficient interest
	- Superintendant resigned, so the district court’s decree doesn’t really affect him in that capacity
	- Dissenting board member would not personally be liable for violating the decree, which is aimed at the board as a whole 
	- Parents may intervene, where they have a sufficient interest, not adequately represented by the Board in its decision not to appeal
		- Interest in children’s education and welfare is sufficient
		- Even assuming Board acted in good faith, its interests in deciding not to appeal were not necessarily aligned with the parents’ interests
		- But interest extends only to parts of the decree that purportedly limit the discretion of the board

#### NRDC v. NRC (10th Cir. 1978)

- Facts & Procedural History
	- NRDC sues to enjoin issuance of license to United Nuclear without environmental impact statement
	- United Nuclear intervened without objection.
	- Other prospective licensees move to intervene, both as of right and permissive
	- Trial court denied motion on ground that interests were adequately represented by United Nuclear
- Holding & Analysis 
	- Other prospective licensees have sufficient interest, and are not adequately represented by United Nuclear
	- Rule 24(a)(2) does not require a “direct interest”, but must be “significantly protectable interest“
		- Interveners have interest, because their license application would likewise be affected by a decision in favor of plaintiffs
		- Interest is specific to intervening party, not general public interest
	- “Impairment of interest” 
		- Not limited to res judicata effect
			- Precedential effect may suffice
		- “[A]s a practical matter”, i.e. not limited to strictly legal impairment
	- Adequate representation:
		- Intervening party has burden to show inadequacy
		- Need only show that representation “may be” inadequate
			- Some difference of interest
		- Turns on the motive of the existing party to litigate
			- Here, United Nuclear has already been granted the license
			- Might have incentive to compromise by agreeing to declaration requiring impact statement prospectively, but not retrospectively as applied to them
			- Also has defense of laches, not available to other applicants. 


### Permissive Intervention

#### Rule 24(b)

- 24(b)(1): Court may permit intervention where 
	- (A) Conditional right to intervene granted by statute, or
	- (B) Claim or defense sharing common question of law or fact
- 24(b)(3): Court must consider undue delay or prejudice to adjudication of original parties’ rights

## Interpleader

## Basic Concept

- Someone has possession of money or property
	- Doesn’t claim ownership
	- Not sure who it belongs to
	- Asks the court to decide among competing claimants
		- Avoids risk of liability for giving the money/property to the wrong claimant
- Example
	- Casper has a life insurance policy, naming his wife, Doris as the primary beneficiary and his sister Delphine as the alternate beneficiary. 
	- Casper dies when he falls from a moving train. 
		- Delphine suspects that Casper’s death was not an accident, and that Doris arranged to have him killed so that she could collect on the insurance.
			- If Doris was responsible for Casper’s murder, state law would disqualify her as a beneficiary, and the benefit would go to Delphine as the alternate beneficiary
		- Doris maintains her innocence and insists that she is entitled to the insurance benefit
	- The insurance company’s dilemma: 
		- If the company refuses to pay the benefit to Doris, she will probably sue them
		- If the company pays Doris and it turns out she did arrange to have Casper killed, Delphine will probably sue them
	- To resolve this dilemma, the insurance company files an interpleader action, asking the court to decide whether Doris or Delphine is the rightful beneficiary.
		- If the insurance company pays in accordance with the court’s order, the company is protected against liability by the losing claimant. 

## Procedure for Interpleader

#### 28 U.S.C. § 1335

- Relaxed requirements for diversity jurisdiction 
	- Diversity
		- Minimal diversity among claimants 
			- Diversity not required between claimants & plaintiff
	- Amount in controversy $500 or more
- Other provisions
	- Plaintiff must deposit money or property with the court
	- Looser venue standard: § 1397
	- Nationwide personal jurisdiction: § 2361
	- Court may restrain other actions affecting the stake
		- But restraint may not extend beyond the stake itself

#### FRCP Rule 22

- Standard requirements for diversity jurisdiction
	- Stakeholder must be diverse from all claimants
		- Diversity among claimants doesn’t matter
		- Amount in controversy greater than $75,000
- Other Provisions
	- No deposit requirement
	- Normal venue standard: § 1391
	- Normal personal jurisdiction requirement: minimum contacts
- Query
	- Given looser requirements for statutory interpleader, why would anyone ever opt for Rule interpleader?
		- Diversity between stakeholder & claimants, but not among claimants
