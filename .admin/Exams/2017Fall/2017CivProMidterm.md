# Facts 

Tiger Foods is a supermarket chain with stores located in North and South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware. The company is organized as a business partnership (unincorporated business) under North Carolina law. The business partners include individuals who reside in North Carolina and South Carolina. 

US Broadcasting Corp. ("UBC") is incorporated in Delaware with its corporate headquarters in New York. UBC produces television programs that air on its national network of stations, including independently-owned affiliates in North and South Carolina. UBC is licensed and regulated under federal law by the Federal Communications Commission. 

Kari Kaplan (a resident of California) is a producer, and Linda Lewis (a resident of South Carolina) is a reporter, for UBC's "Evening Exposé" news program, which airs weekly on the UBC network (including the NC and SC affiliates). For a story on unsavory practices in the retail food industry, Kaplan assigned Lewis to go "undercover" at Tiger Foods. Lewis applied for a job and was hired as a deli counter clerk at a South Carolina Tiger Foods store. Using a hidden camera, she secretly videotaped activity at the store. Among other things, the videos showed store managers instructing employees to relabel past-date foods (including spoiled meats and dairy products) and return them to sale displays. Kaplan included some of the videos in the program, along with a voice-over stating that the practice of relabeling and selling past-date and spoiled foods "violates state and federal laws".  

After the Evening Exposé story airs, sales at Tiger Foods stores fall by 25%. Tiger Foods decides to sue UBC, Kaplan, and Lewis for defamation. Defamation is a state common law claim with the following elements: 

1. The defendant made a false and defamatory statement concerning the plaintiff.
2. The defendant published the statement to others.
3. The defendant acted at least negligently in publishing the statement.
4. The plaintiff suffered damages as a result. 

Tiger Foods alleges that the video footage shown in the program was either doctored or out of context, and denies that it sold past-date or spoiled foods in violation of any state or federal laws. The company seeks $1 million (the amount of lost sales revenue) in damages  against the three defendants jointly and severally. 

## Question 1

If Tiger Foods files its suit in North Carolina, will the court have personal jurisdiction over all three defendants?

## Question 2

Regardless of your answer to the previous question, would a federal court have subject matter jurisdiction over the suit?
